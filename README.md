Hello! This is the code for my boxing safety device. The collection script is run on a raspberry pi with a BNO055 IMU to collect boxing telemetry data (attatched to head). A sample output named "boxing_data4000v1" is provided. Following the collection of data, the analysis script is run to identify punches from chaotic head movement and measure their strength. This analysis includes the number of punches recieved, strength of each punch, and a boxplot created from the punches recieved.
